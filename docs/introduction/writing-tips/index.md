# Technical Writing Tips   
  


## Plan Your Writing  
  
 - Plan your writing in advance.   
 - Draft an index of the topics or ideas you need to explain.    

  
## Keep It Simple  
  
Break long sections into appropriate headers:   
  
`Section (Pages) > Topics > Paragraphs.    
  
- **1 Section** = 1 Main topic/Idea  
- **1 Main Topic/Idea** = N subtopics.  
- **1 Topic/Subtopic** = 1 Paragraph.  
- **1 Paragraph** = 2 or 3 lines.    

## Keep It Simple - Extended Version  
  
Avoid writing more than what it is really needed.  
  
Tech docs provide information, processes, facts to help to solve problems.


  

  
## Affirmative is Better Than Negative    
      
Affirmative Writing Makes Information easily Understandable. For example:   
  
   ```  
    The job rejects Pull Requests from a forked repository  
  
   ```  
  
instead of   
  
  ```  
     The job will not accept a Pull Request from a forked repository.  
  ```  
  
      
## Context, Context and Context  
  
Provide enough context to accomplish the presented action or process.  
  
  
## Think Twice  
  
Think twice or read your text twice. Ask yourself:  
  
- Is it clear enough? 
- Does the reader need context to complete the process?
